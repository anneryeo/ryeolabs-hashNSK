# Enterprise theme — RYEO LABS frontend (example)

This is an example statically-generated blog using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript, adapted and maintained by RYEO LABS. The theme is wired to Hashnode as the content source via Hashnode's public GraphQL APIs.

We've integrated the Hashnode APIs so you can use Hashnode's editor and dashboard to author content while serving a customized frontend from this codebase.

## Want to run this theme?

Fork the repo, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_HOST` environment variable to your Hashnode publication host (e.g. `engineering.hashnode.dev`) and deploy to Vercel. The theme will render content provided by your Hashnode publication.

Demo of the `enterprise` theme (upstream example): [https://demo.hashnode.com/engineering](https://demo.hashnode.com/engineering).
